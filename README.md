A genetic algorithm to create class schedules.

## Getting started

General steps and shell commands are given.

1. Clone this repository

`git clone https://github.com/schance995/cmsc421-group-project.git`

Note: this repository is private, please use a [Github Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) instead of your password to log in.

2. Enter the directory

`cd cmsc421-group-project.git`

3. Create a new branch with your name (real name or Github username)

`git checkout -b <YOUR_NAME_HERE>`

## Development

1. Use the `main` branch for testing the app, and your personal branch for development

You can switch branches like so:

`git checkout <branch>`

2. Add files to track and commit

`git add <filenames>`

And update the ones already tracked:

`git add -u`

3. Commit changes

`git commit -m <message>`

You can also just type `git commit` and a text editor should pop up, where you can write your commit message. Please make it descriptive so you know what you worked on.

**Make sure you set your default editor to one you are comfortable with! For example Windows Git Bash sets the default editor to Vim which is not comfortable if you are not used to it.**

**Please commit changes regularly so you can roll back if needed!**
