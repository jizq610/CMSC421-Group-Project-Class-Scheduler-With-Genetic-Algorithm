# Running the program

Type in classes in the format as described in `src/example-classes.md`

You can also feed classes through standard input:

`python3 main.py < example-classes.md`

## IMPORTANT

The requests-cache dependency is used to avoid hammering umd.io excessively.

Make sure you run the program from the same directory every time to take advantage of this.
